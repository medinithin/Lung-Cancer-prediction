# Lung-Cancer-prediction
In this project we predicted different lung cancers using large dataset  using Machine Learning algorithms. We finally find the best accuracy of the model by obtaining R-squared vaues. 
in this project we have done 10 steps 
1. importing libraries
2. load the dataset
3. basic data exploration
4. data preprocessing
5. data visualization
6. data spliting
7. model building
8. evaluation
9. confusion matrix
